## Algorithms used:
Clustering (KMeans, Mean-Shift, DBScan)
Association rules (basic)
Classification (KNN, Native Bayer, Decision Tree)
## Classification Algorithm
Purpose: Predict and classify data into different groups or labels.

Applications in Report:

Predict customer likelihood to purchase products in the future.

Classify emails as spam or not spam.

Identify individuals at risk of diseases based on medical data.
## Clustering Algorithm
Purpose: Group similar data points together without the need for labels.

Applications in Report:

Segment customers based on shopping behavior to optimize marketing strategies.

Detect hidden trends in sales data.

Identify anomalies in financial transactions or security.

## Association Rule Mining Algorithm
Purpose: Discover relationships or hidden patterns between items in the data.

Applications in Report:
